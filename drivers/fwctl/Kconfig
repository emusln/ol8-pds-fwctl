	help
	  fwctl provides a userspace API for restricted access to communicate
	  with on-device firmware. The communication channel is intended to
	  support a wide range of lockdown compatible device behaviors including
	  manipulating device FLASH, debugging, and other activities that don't
	  fit neatly into an existing subsystem.

config FWCTL_MLX5

	depends on MLX5_CORE
	help
	  MLX5CTL provides interface for the user process to access the debug and
	  configuration registers of the ConnectX hardware family
	  (NICs, PCI switches and SmartNIC SoCs).
	  This will allow configuration and debug tools to work out of the box on
	  mainstream kernel.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

	help
	  The nicctl userspace utility provides an interface for users to access
	  debug and configuration information features of the AMD/Pensando DSC
	  family.  This pds_fwctl driver is the kernel interface to open the channel
	  from userspace through the pds_core driver and into the DSC firmware.
